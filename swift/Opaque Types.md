Looking at the new SwiftUI tutorials I've noticed a new keyword `some`. Apparently `some` was introduced in Swift 5.1 
to declare [Opaque Type](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Types.html#ID616). Short version is that
opaque type allows function to return a protocol instead of concrete type while retaining some knowledge of an underlying type.

For long version see: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/187/how-to-use-opaque-return-types-in-swift-5-1
